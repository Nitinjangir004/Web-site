### Unified Data Loading Strategy
- **Single Entry Point**: Header component triggers all data loading

### API Service Features (All Content Types)
- **Retry Logic**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error catching and logging
- **Query Parameter Building**: Dynamic filter construction for all endpoints
- **Response Normalization**: Consistent data structure handling across all content types
- **URL Encoding**: Proper encoding for special characters in search terms

### Content Store State Structure
Each content store follows consistent pattern:
```javascript
{
  // Main content arrays
  [contentType]: [], // All items
  featured[ContentType]: [], // Featured items
  
  // Specialized data
  [specialField]: [], // moods, narrators, presenters, authors, ages
  
  // Filtered results
  [contentType]By[Filter]: {
    [items]: [],
    [filterField]: ''
  },
  
  // Search results
  searchResults: {
    results: [],
    query: ''
  },
  
  // Current item
  current[ContentType]: null,
  
  // Error states
  error: {
    [contentType]: null,
    featured[ContentType]: null,
    // ... etc for all operations
  }
}
```
